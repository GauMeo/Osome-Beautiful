Silane Crystal Red Shrimp * CRS **
Start Off in a Pure Way 
To start off your Pure Red Line (纯系) breeding program without golden (white shrimp) recessive genes, the best way to send them for DNA test. But.... thats the practical, here, is another method that can be carried out to validate your Pure Red Line breeding stock carries golden genes. Golden CRS offshrings can appear after many generation of breeding if the inital breeding stock is not tested even without intensional introduction of golden genes.
Golden genes in Pure Red Line is deemed undesirable by majorities in communities around the world. 
The method as follow: 
- Pair A: PRL female with a golden male
- Pair B: PRL male with a golden female
If Pair A has no golden offsprings but all red offsprings, then the female in Pair A does not has golden genes.
If Pair B has no golden offsprings but all red offsprings, then the  male in Pair B does not has golden genes.
After you have comfirm both PRL of different sex has no golden genes, put these 2 together to breed, the offsprings are comfirmed not to carry golden genes, so will be the offsprings' offspring.
The chances of these 2 to breed out golden offsprings, the chance of it will be extremely remote, just like striking a $10mil lottery, but this time, the breeder get no prize.
